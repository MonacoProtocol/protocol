# Monaco Protocol Client Account Types

This package provides type declarations for most Monaco Protocol accounts. These are used by `@monaco-protocol/client` but also maybe useful if using the account data generated by the client elsewhere in your stack.

It also provides _Primitive_ variants of these types, where external types have been converted to primitive types, e.g., `BN` to `number` or `Date` where appropriate, and `PublicKey` to `string` (Base58).

# Documentation

The type declartions should be self documenting. [documentationjs](https://github.com/documentationjs/documentation) doesn't yet seem to support `interface` correctly.

To generate the docs as they are you can run
```
npm run generateDocs
```
