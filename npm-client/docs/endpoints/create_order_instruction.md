## buildOrderInstructionUIStake

Constructs the instruction required to perform a create order transaction using a UI stake value, the client calculates the actual stake value based on mintInfo.data.decimals using uiStakeToInteger().

### Parameters

*   `program` **Program** {program} anchor program initialized by the consuming client
*   `marketPk` **PublicKey** {PublicKey} publicKey of the market to create the order for
*   `marketOutcomeIndex` **[number][7]** {number} index of the chosen outcome
*   `forOutcome` **[boolean][8]** {boolean} whether the order is for or against the outcome
*   `price` **[number][7]** {number} price at which the order should be created, the price should be present on the outcome pool for the market
*   `stake` **[number][7]** {number} UI value of the stake, the function will determine the raw value based on the market token type
*   `priceLadderPk` **PublicKey?** {PublicKey} Optional: publicKey of the price ladder associated with the market outcome - if there is one
*   `productPk` **PublicKey?** {PublicKey} Optional: publicKey of product account this order was created on

### Examples

```javascript
const marketPk = new PublicKey('7o1PXyYZtBBDFZf9cEhHopn2C9R4G6GaPwFAxaNWM33D')
const marketOutcomeIndex = 0
const forOutcome = true
const price = 1.5
const stake = 20,000,000,000
const priceLadderPk = new PublicKey('Dopn2C9R4G6GaPwFAxaNWM33D7o1PXyYZtBBDFZf9cEhH')
const productPk = new PublicKey('yourNewExcHangeZf9cEhHopn2C9R4G6GaPwFAxaNWM33D')
const instruction = await buildOrderInstructionUIStake(program, marketPk, marketOutcomeIndex, forOutcome, price, stake, priceLadderPk, productPk)
```

Returns **OrderInstructionResponse** derived order publicKey and the instruction to perform a create order transaction

## buildOrderInstruction

Constructs a create order request instruction using the raw token value for the order stake.

No order account will be created until the order request is sent as part of a transaction, and then processed by the protocol,
but the orderPk returned by this function will match the PDA of the order account to be created.

### Parameters

*   `program` **Program** {program} anchor program initialized by the consuming client
*   `marketPk` **PublicKey** {PublicKey} publicKey of the market to create the order for
*   `marketOutcomeIndex` **[number][7]** {number} index of the chosen outcome
*   `forOutcome` **[boolean][8]** {boolean} whether the order is for or against the outcome
*   `price` **[number][7]** {number} price at which the order should be created, the price should be present on the outcome pool for the market
*   `stake` **BN** {BN} raw token value of the order taking into account the decimal amount of the token associated with the market
*   `options` **{priceLadderPk: PublicKey?, productPk: PublicKey?, expiresOn: BN?}**&#x20;

    *   `options.priceLadderPk`  {PublicKey} Optional: publicKey of the price ladder associated with the market outcome - if there is one
    *   `options.productPk`  {PublicKey} Optional: publicKey of product account this order was created on
    *   `options.expiresOn`  {BN} Optional: unix timestamp (seconds) defining expiration of request; if omitted or null or undefined order request will never expire

### Examples

```javascript
const marketPk = new PublicKey('7o1PXyYZtBBDFZf9cEhHopn2C9R4G6GaPwFAxaNWM33D')
const marketOutcomeIndex = 0
const forOutcome = true
const price = 1.5
const stake = 20,000,000,000
const priceLadderPk = new PublicKey('Dopn2C9R4G6GaPwFAxaNWM33D7o1PXyYZtBBDFZf9cEhH')
const productPk = new PublicKey('yourNewExcHangeZf9cEhHopn2C9R4G6GaPwFAxaNWM33D')
const expiresOn = new BN(1010101010101)
const instruction = await buildOrderInstruction(program, marketPk, marketOutcomeIndex, forOutcome, price, stake, {priceLadderPk, productPk, expiresOn} )
```

Returns **OrderInstructionResponse** derived order publicKey and the instruction to perform a create order transaction
