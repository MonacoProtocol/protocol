## createMarketWithOutcomesAndPriceLadder

For the given parameters:

*   Create a wagering market that accepts orders in the provided market token
*   Create outcome accounts for the provided outcomes
*   Applies the given priceLadder to all outcomes in batches

### Parameters

*   `program` **Program** {program} anchor program initialized by the consuming client
*   `marketName` **[string][7]** {string} title of the market being created
*   `marketType` **MarketType** {MarketType} type of the market being created
*   `marketTokenPk` **PublicKey** {PublicKey} publicKey of the mint token being used to place an order on a market
*   `marketLockTimestamp` **EpochTimeStamp** {EpochTimeStamp} timestamp in seconds representing when the market can no longer accept orders
*   `eventAccountPk` **PublicKey** {PublicKey} publicKey of the event the market is associated with
*   `outcomes` **[Array][8]<[string][7]>** {string\[]} list of possible outcomes for the market
*   `priceLadder` **[Array][8]<[number][9]>** {number\[]} array of price points to add to the outcome
*   `eventStartTimestamp` **EpochTimeStamp?** {EpochTimeStamp} timestamp in seconds representing when the event starts (defaults to marketLockTimestamp)
*   `inplayEnabled` **[boolean][10]?** {boolean} whether the market can accept orders after the event starts (defaults to false)
*   `inplayOrderDelay` **[number][9]?** {number} number of seconds an inplay order must wait before its liquidity is added to the market and can be matched (defaults to 0)
*   `eventStartOrderBehaviour` **MarketOrderBehaviour?** {MarketOrderBehaviour} protocol behaviour to perform when the event start timestamp is reached (defaults to MarketOrderBehaviour.None)
*   `marketLockOrderBehaviour` **MarketOrderBehaviour?** {MarketOrderBehaviour} protocol behaviour to perform when the market lock timestamp is reached (defaults to MarketOrderBehaviour.None)
*   `batchSize` **[number][9]?** {number} number of prices to add in a single request

### Examples

```javascript
const name = "Full Time Result"
const type = MarketType.EventResultWinner
const marketTokenPk = new PublicKey('7xKXtg2CW87d97TXJSDpbD5jBkheTqA83TZRuJosgAsU')
const marketLock = 1633042800
const eventAccountPk = new PublicKey('E4YEQpkedH8SbcRkN1iByoRnH8HZeBcTnqrrWkjpqLXA')
const outcomes = ["Red", "Draw", "Blue"]
const priceLadder = DEFAULT_PRICE_LADDER
const batchSize = 100
const newMarket = await createMarket(program, name, type, marketTokenPk, marketLock, eventAccountPk, outcomes, priceLadder, batchSize)
```

Returns **CreateMarketWithOutcomesAndPriceLadderResponse** containing the newly-created market account publicKey, creation transaction ID, the market account and the results of the batched requests to add prices to the outcome accounts
