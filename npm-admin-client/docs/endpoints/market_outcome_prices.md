## addPricesToOutcome

For the given market and outcome index, add the provided prices to the price ladder for that outcome - program must be initialized by the `MARKET` operator that initialised the market

### Parameters

*   `program` **Program** {program} anchor program initialized by the consuming client
*   `marketPk` **PublicKey** {publicKey} publicKey for the market the outcome is associated with
*   `outcomeIndex` **[number][10]** {number} index representing the outcome on the market
*   `priceLadder` **[Array][11]<[number][10]>** {number\[]} array of price points to add to the outcome

### Examples

```javascript
const marketPk = new PublicKey('7o1PXyYZtBBDFZf9cEhHopn2C9R4G6GaPwFAxaNWM33D')
const priceLadder = [5, 6, 7, 8]
const outcomeIndex = 1
const addPrices = await addPricesToOutcome(program, marketPk, outcomeIndex, priceLadder)
```

Returns **AddPricesToOutcomeResponse** the transaction ID for the request and confirmation of the ladder passed

## batchAddPricesToOutcomePool

Batch process to, for the given market and outcome, add the provided prices to the price ladder for that outcome - program must be initialized by the `MARKET` operator that initialised the market.

A batch is how many elements from the priceLadder to add in a single request.

### Parameters

*   `program` **Program** {program} anchor program initialized by the consuming client
*   `marketPk` **PublicKey** {publicKey} publicKey for the market the outcome is associated with
*   `outcomeIndex` **[number][10]** {number} index representing the outcome on the market
*   `priceLadder` **[Array][11]<[number][10]>** {number\[]} array of price points to add to the outcome
*   `batchSize` **[number][10]** {number} number of prices to add in a single request

### Examples

```javascript
const marketPk = new PublicKey('7o1PXyYZtBBDFZf9cEhHopn2C9R4G6GaPwFAxaNWM33D')
const priceLadder = [5, 6, 7, 8]
const outcomeIndex = 1
const batchSize = 2
const batchAddPrices = await batchAddPricesToOutcomePool(program, marketPk, outcomeIndex, priceLadder, batchSize)
```

Returns **BatchAddPricesToOutcomeResponse** array of the batches sent during the request containing the transaction ID for the request and confirmation of the ladder passed

## batchAddPricesToAllOutcomePools

Batch process to, for the given market, add the provided prices to the price ladder for all outcomes - program must be initialized by the `MARKET` operator that initialised the market.

A batch is how many elements from the priceLadder to add in a single request.

### Parameters

*   `program` **Program** {program} anchor program initialized by the consuming client
*   `marketPk` **PublicKey** {publicKey} publicKey for the market the outcome is associated with
*   `priceLadder` **[Array][11]<[number][10]>** {number\[]} array of price points to add to the outcome
*   `batchSize` **[number][10]** {number} number of prices to add in a single request

### Examples

```javascript
const marketPk = new PublicKey('7o1PXyYZtBBDFZf9cEhHopn2C9R4G6GaPwFAxaNWM33D')
const priceLadder = [5, 6, 7, 8]
const batchSize = 2
const batchAddPrices = await batchAddPricesToAllOutcomePools(program, marketPk, priceLadder, batchSize)
```

Returns **BatchAddPricesToOutcomeResponse** array of the batches sent during the request containing the transaction ID for the request and confirmation of the ladder passed
