/*
 * Order Creation Payment 1
 *
 * This test case covers situation when patron creates combination of for and against orders that result in refund.
 *
 * Scenario 1:
 *
 * Patron creates an order of X @ 3.00 for an outcome of the market with three outcomes.
 * Subsequently patron creates two orders of X @ 3.90 against the same outcome.
 * Patron's starting market position is [0, 0, 0] and final market position should be [-5.8*X, X, X].
 * First order should take payment of X. Second order should take 0.9*X as opposed to 2.9*X if it was created on its own.
 * Third order should take payment of 2.9*X as expected.
 * Total payment taken should be 5.8*X as opposed to 6.8*X if they were created each on their own.
